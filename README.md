## Introduction

Mobile applications have become an integral part of people's lives, offering convenient solutions to various challenges. They save time, money, and provide effortless access to a wide range of services. However, in Palestine, accessing legal services and connecting with lawyers can be cumbersome and time-consuming.

To address this issue, we have developed Qadaa, a mobile application built using React Native. Qadaa streamlines legal transactions and facilitates connections with lawyers, providing a seamless and efficient experience for users. With this application, users can initiate legal procedures, engage in chat and phone conversations with lawyers, obtain directions to their offices, and even schedule appointments - all from their mobile phones.

Furthermore, Qadaa features a comprehensive map displaying all courts in the West Bank, helping users identify the nearest available lawyer. By incorporating these services into a single application, Qadaa significantly enhances the efficiency of searching for legal assistance.

One notable feature of Qadaa is the inclusion of a forum page where individuals and lawyers can engage in discussions about legal issues. This forum provides a platform exclusively for licensed lawyers to address users' concerns, fostering an environment of trust and credibility.

Through Qadaa, we aim to revolutionize the accessibility and convenience of legal services in Palestine, enabling users to navigate legal procedures effortlessly and connect with professional lawyers efficiently.
